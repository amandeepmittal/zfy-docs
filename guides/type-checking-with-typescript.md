Due to time constraints, we were not able to finish this page. However, please know that the entirety of the library has been written in TypeScript. Feel free to [check the existing API reference](../api-reference/types/), [browse the type interfaces](https://github.com/colorfy-software/zfy/blob/main/src/types.ts) or [open an issue](https://github.com/colorfy-software/zfy/issues/new) if you need assistance with anything.
